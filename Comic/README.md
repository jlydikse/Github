# Overview

I decided to make this Comic Book Inventory System in order to practice my new learning with C++. I like the idea of creating an inventory system for different scenarios.

# Development Environment

I was able to use C++ in order to create this inventory system. Along with other headers, I used the iostream header in order to use the cin / cout.

# Future Work


- I want to finish the web scraper program I made, and make sure that it works as intended. I spent a lot of time on that.
- I want to make the inventory system perform more calculations that it currently does.
- I want to forecast supply / demand within the inventory system in order to set up a reordering process.
