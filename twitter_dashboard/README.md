# Overview

This was my attempt at creating a Social Media Dashboard. I tried, but did not complete this. I really was trying to aggregate my feeds from facebook, twitter, etc. After many attempts, watching youtube videos, and trying to figure it out on my own, I was unable to successfully complete this, and will likely come back to it in the future.


# Development Environment

I used JavaScript to write what code I came up with, along with HTML and some CSS.

# Future Work


- I need to figure out why my API is not working
- I need to create a much more compelling UI
- I need to figure out how to use multiple APIs (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
